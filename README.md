## DES (Data Encryption Standard)

DES is a block cipher algorithm that uses a 64-bit symmetric key on disk, but operates with a 56-bit key when submitted and generates 16 48-bit subkeys. These 16 subkeys are derived from the 56 bits through a total of 16 iterations.

DES is currently considered insecure in many applications due to the 56-bit key size. Thus, on May 26, 2002, DES was finally replaced by the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) after a public competition (as mentioned in my previous post, you can see how superior AES is).

In summary, DES is the oldest and "secure" algorithm used to encrypt fixed-size texts using a fixed-size key.
